# P0: Hello, World

This initial project just intantiates the identity module.
The hardward contraints file sets this up as a light switch
for an led. This is effectively a *Hello, World* style
test that I can use to build other projects.

## Building Requirements

- Xilinx Vivado
- I haven't yet built this on hardware

## Building Instructions

```bash
make sim # runs the simulator, should display "passed"
```
